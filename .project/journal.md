- 2026-09-19 · RESEARCH · Three research passes (AI-ready platforms, proteomics resources, aging output inventory) are saved to lit/ and design/. FRAMEWORK.md v0 is proposed. It covers Parquet+DuckDB, FastAPI+MCP, LinkML, QPX superset and USI. Decisions G2/G3 are open.

## 2026-09-19 - First session: from "where do I begin" to a proposed framework

The user runs a strong search-and-quant pipeline (aging) but has no way to organize its results for
humans or AI. They asked me to study how the best bio projects make data AI-ready and to propose a
framework, and said they would rely on me for the server side. Three parallel research passes ran: AI-ready
platforms (CELLxGENE Census, Open Targets, EBI/UniProt/NCBI, MCP practice, Croissant/RO-Crate/Bioschemas),
proteomics resources (QPX/quantms portal, PRIDE v3, USI/PROXI, ProteomicsDB, jPOST, organelle and aging
atlases), and an inventory of what the aging pipeline actually writes on F:.

The conclusions that shaped FRAMEWORK.md v0:
- **Standardized metadata beats the choice of engine.** CELLxGENE's required schema is what makes
  its cross-dataset queries possible. For us, the age axis is the scarce asset.
- **Files are the product.** bigbio's quantms portal has already built almost exactly this. It uses
  Parquet, a prebuilt DuckDB file, and FastAPI plus task-level MCP tools. It is the precedent to copy,
  but it lacks proteoforms and USIs, and its MCP endpoint redirected to the wrong path when tested.
- **Agents do best with a few curated tools benchmarked against a question set.** Open Targets went
  from 45 tools to 5.
- **The data is small.** It comes to about 3 MB of tables per raw file, or a few GB at 300 datasets.
  There is no case for clusters or Postgres.

Nothing is locked yet. The user asked to close before reviewing the framework, so every
recommendation is still a proposal.
